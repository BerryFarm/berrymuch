# HOW TO CONNECT TO A SERIAL DEVICE USING THE BLACKBERRY PASSPORT SE

## Steps

- you need a microusb cable to connect to the device
- to see if your device is connected and recognized look for serusb1 in /dev 
- you can try "echo hello > /dev/serusb1" or "cat > /dev/serusb1" 
- depending the device and its purpose you may need to program it etc


## Tested Units
so far I have tested an Arduino UNO and Tessel 2. the Tessel 2 has a terminal running that I can interact with using the echo command
