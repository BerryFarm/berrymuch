TinyOAL requires at least GCC 4.8.1, as ISO C++ 2011 standard support is required

BB10-NDK provides GCC 4.6.3 and 4.8.3

How do we enable 4.8.3 ?


*******************************************************************************************************************
C++11 Support in GCC
GCC 4.8.1 was the first feature-complete implementation of the 2011 C++ standard, previously known as C++0x.

This mode can be selected with the -std=c++11 command-line flag, or -std=gnu++11 to enable GNU extensions as well.
