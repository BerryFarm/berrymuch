Compile seafile needs Vala compiler

The Vala compiler produces C code. So you will also need a C compiler to produce the executable binary of the program. The binary runs on the native platform, although cross-compiling for other platforms is possible.


***********************************

To have the build.sh script running on Darwin 15.6.0
aclocal installed from brew, I had to follow the below instructions

Please add the files
  codeset.m4 gettext.m4 glibc21.m4 iconv.m4 isc-posix.m4 lcmessage.m4
  progtest.m4
from the /usr/local/Cellar/glib/2.56.0/share/aclocal directory to your autoconf macro directory
or directly to your aclocal.m4 file.
You will also need config.guess and config.sub, which you can get from
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/config/.

Here is what I did:
