go build: when using gc toolchain, please pass compile flags using -gcflags, and linker flags using -ldflags


TODO ( work in progress )

Build a Docker environment for golang cross compilation for arm

###

Latest error hit:

While trying to cross-compile hello-world.go for berrymuch, I hit the following issue

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67435581/golang-cgo-android-ndk-missing-pthread/76509676#76509676

This may be reproduced like this:

git clone https://github.com/BerryFarm/berrymuch.git --branch ports-golang --depth=1
make build-golang.hello-world


Any hint would be greatly appreciated at this point ðŸ™‚

-pthread is a linker flag for systems where the posix thread support resides in the libpthread library. It seems QNX doesn't have this lib or it named differently. For example on Haiku the pthread functions always linked in unconditionally, therefore the solution for this kind of errors is simply: remove the -pthread flag.

So i would recommend you to check where the pthread stuff lives on QNX

pthread_create
Create a thread

Yeah, it is in libc on QNX: https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.5.0SP1.update/com.qnx.doc.neutrino_lib_ref/p/pthread_create.html

Library:
libc
Use the -l c option to qcc to link against this library. This library is usually included automatically.

ok ! so find a way to trigger use -lc instead of -lpthread  ðŸ™‚

grep the sources :)

it should be in a makefile, or m4 file, or in config file, or in cmake file, or in similar stuff

[resolved] failed to cross-compile QNX on ubuntu16 Â· Issue #2486 Â· eclipse/mosquitto
When I cross-compiled the library on ubuntu16.04, I could not find -lpthread and -ldl when linking, causing the build to fail. After a period of investigation, I found that the following codes were...

hmm good advice . Probably my issue might have similarities with https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2486

Thanks a lot ! Iâ€™ll keep you up to date about this exciting topic ðŸ™‚
